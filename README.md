# News Headline Classification

This repository contains a dataset of news article headlines labeled with four categories: 'World' (0), 'Sports' (1), 'Business' (2), and 'Sci/Tech' (3). The goal of this project is to build a text classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict the category of a given news headline.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of news article headlines, and each headline is associated with one of the following numerical labels:

0: World

1: Sports

2: Business

3: Sci/Tech

## Model
The Naive Bayes algorithm is used for text classification in this project. The model is trained on the provided dataset to classify news headlines into one of the four categories.

## Streamlit Application
The Streamlit application allows users to input a news headline and get the predicted category using the trained Naive Bayes model.

To use the application, follow these steps:

Run the Streamlit application as mentioned in the previous section.
Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501).
Enter a news headline in the input box.
Click the "Predict" button to see the predicted category.
